# AMLHC-final-exam

This repository, created by Alisa Ochs and Andre Schomakers, represents the final exam in Module 12:
Application of Machine Learning in Health Care, taught by DI Dr. Michael Netzer.

We have chosen _Chest X-Rays Computer Vision Project_ dataset with over 5000 chest xray images from infants to classify pneumonia (binary classification) using a Residual Network with 50 layers (ResNet50). 

For this task, the paper:

Kermany DS, Goldbaum M, Cai W, Valentim CCS, Liang H, Baxter SL, et al. Identifying medical diagnoses and treatable diseases by Image-Based Deep Learning. Cell [Internet]. 2018 Feb 1;172(5):1122-1131.e9. Available from: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.010

was used where their data was published on the Mendeley database, where we downloaded the "ChestXray2017" dataset [Mendeley](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/3).

Next to Kermany et al.'s paper, we also found inspiration for preprocessing and model setup here:

Showkat S, Qureshi S. Efficacy of Transfer Learning-based ResNet models in Chest X-ray image classification for detecting COVID-19 Pneumonia. Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems [Internet]. 2022 Mar 10;224:104534. Available from: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2022.104534


This analysis was performed on a sample and represents an experiment for the Module 12 class by Dr. Netzer.
